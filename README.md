# A-Simple-Elastic-SIEM-Lab

## Elastic Stack SIEM Home Lab Setup

### Overview
This repository contains the configuration files, scripts, and documentation for setting up an Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab using a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). This lab is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with Elastic SIEM by generating and analyzing security events in a controlled environment.

### Features
- **Elastic Stack SIEM Configuration:** Step-by-step guide to set up Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment.
- **Kali Linux VM Deployment:** Instructions on how to install and configure a Kali Linux VM.
- **Security Event Simulation:** Scripts and examples for generating security events using Nmap.
- **Log Forwarding and Analysis:** Configuration of Elastic Agent on Kali Linux for log collection and forwarding to Elastic SIEM.
- **Custom Dashboard Creation:** Visualize security events using Elastic SIEM's dashboard features.
- **Alerting:** Set up and manage alert rules to detect specific security incidents.

### Usage
1. Follow the instructions in the `Setup Guide` to configure the environment.
2. Use the `nmap_scan.sh` script to generate security events on the Kali VM.
3. Analyze and visualize the results in the Elastic SIEM dashboard.
4. Configure alerts to monitor for specific security events.

### Dashboard Output
Included in this repository is a screenshot of the custom dashboard created to visualize the results of an `nmap -p- localhost` scan.
